# OVI: Overcome VIrus
## Project realized in the context of LauzHack 2020

Quarantined people need a way to keep alive the attention to prophylaxis measures even when the virus is not perceived as an immediate threat because even the smaller oversight may lead to illness. To tackle this problem, we propose a virtual game in the form of a friendly buddy named OVI (Overcome VIrus), that must be kept alive by enhancing good habits.
